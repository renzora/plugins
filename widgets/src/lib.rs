#![no_std]
//! Every ember widget the panel path can reach, in one panel.
//!
//! Deliberately does nothing: no systems, no assets, no spawning. If something
//! here looks wrong the fault is in the BSN parser, the widget's component
//! front-end, or the widget itself — there is nothing else it could be.
//!
//! Note what is *not* here: any vocabulary this plugin had to learn. The panel
//! is the same BSN a scene is, and `EmberDropdown` / `EmberTable` /
//! `EmberTimeline` are ordinary components the engine registered — so this
//! plugin names them the same way it would name `Transform`.
