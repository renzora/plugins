//! World-global wind.
//!
//! Two jobs:
//!
//! 1. **Evaluate.** Read `WorldEnvironment`'s authored wind section into the
//!    shared [`renzora::WindState`] resource every frame, including the gust
//!    envelope and the smoothed sea state. Grass, the cloud deck, the ocean and
//!    cloth all read that one resource — see [`renzora::wind`] for why they
//!    used to disagree.
//! 2. **Sway.** Give any mesh tagged [`WindSway`] a vertex-animated variant of
//!    its material, so trees, bushes and hand-modelled foliage move.
//!
//! # Materials are shared, not per-entity
//!
//! Swapping in a [`WindSwayMaterial`] per entity would give a 500-tree forest
//! 500 materials and 500 bind groups. Instead [`WindMaterialCache`] keys on the
//! source material plus the quantized per-mesh response, so a forest of
//! identical trees collapses back to one material — and the per-frame wind
//! update then touches a handful of assets rather than a thousand.
