// The wind displacement model, shared by the forward and prepass vertex
// entry points so depth, shadows and the lit pass can never disagree about
// where a vertex is. They *must* agree: leaves are `AlphaMode::Mask`, so they
// write depth in the prepass, and a vertex that lands in a different place in
// the two passes z-fights against its own prepass sample and flickers.
//
// Time is a parameter rather than read from `globals` in here, because the
// globals uniform sits at a DIFFERENT BINDING in the two pipelines —
// `@group(0) @binding(11)` in the forward mesh-view layout, `@group(0)
// @binding(1)` in the prepass layout. Importing it into a shared module would
// bake one of those in and fail to bind in the other pass.
