//! `WindSwayMaterial` — StandardMaterial plus a wind-animated vertex stage.
//!
//! Bevy's `StandardMaterial` has no vertex hook, so a mesh using it is rigid by
//! construction. This rides on top of it as a `MaterialExtension`, replacing
//! only the vertex stage (forward *and* prepass, which is also what shadows go
//! through) and leaving the entire PBR fragment path — alpha masking, IBL,
//! shadows, fog, transmission — exactly as it was. A leaf card keeps its cutout
//! and its lighting and gains motion.
//!
//! # Why the parameters are per-material and not global
//!
//! The obvious design is one global wind uniform every shader reads. There is
//! nowhere to put it: the mesh-view bind group is Bevy's, and adding a binding
//! to it restructures a layout shared by every PBR draw in the engine (the
//! failure mode this codebase has already been bitten by twice). So the wind
//! rides in the material's own bind group instead.
//!
//! That would be expensive if it meant rewriting every material every frame —
//! `Assets::get_mut` marks the asset modified, which rebuilds its bind group.
//! It doesn't, because the *animation* is driven by `globals.time` inside the
//! shader. The uniform only carries the slowly-varying authored wind, so it is
//! written when the wind actually changes and not otherwise: a still scene
//! costs zero uploads while still moving on screen.
