//! Procedural hair groom, as a standalone C-ABI plugin.
//!
//! Put [`Hair`] on any entity with a mesh and the plugin grows strands over that
//! mesh's surface: it area-samples root points across the triangles, grows a
//! tapered strand from each along the surface normal (drooping toward gravity),
//! verlet-simulates them so they sway, and rebuilds a camera-facing ribbon mesh
//! every frame so the hair reads from any angle.
//!
//! Ported from the Bevy-linking `crates/renzora_hair`. It is the first plugin to
//! use both halves of the mesh surface at once, and it is worth saying why each
//! is needed, because between them they are what made this port possible at all:
//!
//! * **Reading** — strands are scattered over a mesh the plugin did not create.
//!   Without `Meshes::read` a groom would have nothing to grow from.
//! * **Writing** — the ribbon geometry is rebuilt every frame, since the ribbons
//!   turn to face the camera. `add_mesh_data` is init-only, so this needs
//!   `Meshes::write` to replace the geometry from a system.
//!
//! ## What changed in the port
//!
//! * The groom's own state (strand points, verlet history) lives in a plugin
//!   resource keyed by entity rather than in a component. Component fields are a
//!   closed set of numeric kinds — no `Vec` — so per-strand data cannot live
//!   there. A resource is the plugin's own memory and can hold anything.
//! * Visibility is not settable across the boundary, so `enabled: false` writes
//!   an empty mesh instead of hiding the render entity.
//! * The simulation runs whenever `simulate` is on. The engine version gated it
//!   on `PlayState::is_scripts_running` so hair held still while editing; play
//!   state is not exposed to plugins, so that is now the author's toggle.
