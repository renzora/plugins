//! Water surface configuration — the authored half of the FFT ocean.
//!
//! The surface is described by a small number of **wave cascades**. Each
//! cascade is an independent ocean simulation over its own square tile
//! (`tile_length`), driven by a JONSWAP/TMA spectrum with Hasselmann
//! directional spreading. Layering cascades with different tile lengths is what
//! hides the tiling: a 400 m swell and a 16 m chop repeat at different
//! intervals, so the eye never locks onto a period.
//!
//! Every parameter here is a *sea state* parameter (wind speed, fetch, swell,
//! whitecap threshold), not a wave shape — the shape falls out of the spectrum.
//! That is the whole point of the FFT approach and why there is no longer a
//! list of hand-authored waves.
