//! Lens distortion — a thin wrapper around **Bevy 0.19's built-in
//! `LensDistortion`** (`bevy::post_process::effect_stack`). Same
//! settings→sync→camera pattern as `renzora_ssr` / `renzora_vignette`:
//! `LensDistortionSettings` is authored on a `WorldEnvironment`-style entity and
//! routed onto cameras, where bevy's post-process effect stack renders it.

// built with, so a privately resolved copy does not implement the trait the
// bound wants — it fails as "multiple different versions of crate serde_core".
// Taking the re-export also leaves this plugin with no third-party dependency
// at all, so cargo is never invoked and the build is one `rustc`.

// crate while this shipped in the binary, because the runtime half had to
// compile lean; a plugin is only ever loaded by an editor or a game that
// already carries the shared images, so the split buys nothing here.
