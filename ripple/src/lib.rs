#![no_std]
//! A custom shaded material, driven by the plugin's own component, over a
//! texture the plugin regenerates every frame.
//!
//! ## What it is for
//!
//! It exists to be *looked at*. Between them, [`Ripple`] and its shader exercise
//! every part of the material path in one entity: the uniform at
//! `@group(3) @binding(0)`, a texture and sampler above it, per-frame uniform
//! refresh from the component, and per-frame pixel upload through
//! [`Images::write`]. Any of those failing is visible rather than silent — see
//! *Reading the result* below.
//!
//! That mattered because the path had never drawn a frame when this was written.
//! A material plugin is the one part of the surface where a mistake produces a
//! black quad instead of a compiler error, so the surface wanted something that
//! turns each possible mistake into a distinguishable picture.
//!
//! ## Reading the result
//!
//! Add **Ripple** to any entity. Geometry that already has a mesh keeps its
//! shape and only changes material; anything else becomes a two-metre plane. You
//! get coloured rings travelling outwards over a drifting plasma either way.
//!
//! | What you see | What is wrong |
//! |---|---|
//! | Rings over plasma, animating | Nothing — this is the whole path working |
//! | Flat black | The uniform is not arriving; the bind group index is wrong |
//! | Rings, but flat white background | The texture is not bound; sampling fell back |
//! | Rings frozen, plasma frozen | The per-frame refresh is not running |
//! | Plasma drifts, rings frozen | [`Images::write`] works, the uniform refresh does not |
//! | Nothing at all | The material was refused at init — check the log |
//!
//! ## The one thing that reads oddly
//!
//! [`Ripple`] carries two `_pad` fields it never uses, and one of them holds
//! plugin state. That is not sloppiness: the component *is* the uniform, byte for
//! byte, so a field added for the plugin's own bookkeeping would shift every
//! member after it and silently corrupt the shader's view. Padding the WGSL side
//! already requires is the only space available. See [`Ripple::_ready`].
