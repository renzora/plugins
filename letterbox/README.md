# Letterbox

Black bars top and bottom, for cutscenes and cinematic framing.

`aspect_ratio` at zero means "use `bar_height` directly". Give it a real ratio instead and the bars size themselves to crop the view to it, which is what you want for a cutscene that has to look the same on every display.

For a narrow picture on a wide display, use **Pillarbox**.

**Add it:** `+ Add Entity → Post Process → Letterbox`, or Add Component on an entity you already have.

**Settings:** `bar_height`, `softness`, `aspect_ratio`

**Shader:** `src/letterbox.wgsl` · **Scope:** Runtime (editor viewport and shipped game)
