//! UI Layout panel — where bevy_ui's per-frame cost actually goes.
//!
//! This exists because of a concrete misdiagnosis. Opening the inspector's
//! component sections cost ~3.3 ms/frame (60 fps → 50 fps), and the obvious
//! suspect was reactivity — "the inspector must be recomputing every frame".
//! It was not: the whole reactive layer measured 0.23 ms, and only four
//! bindings produced a new value that frame. Something else was spending 3.3 ms,
//! and no panel could say what.
//!
//! Opening a section does not add binding work. It adds *visible nodes*, and
//! bevy_ui charges for those whether or not anything about them changed:
//! `ui_layout_system` walks the tree unconditionally, and text measurement runs
//! for every visible label before it. So the number worth watching is not "how
//! many bindings ran" but "how many nodes are on screen and what does laying
//! them out cost".
//!
//! ## How the timings are taken
//!
//! Bevy exposes no per-system timing without a Tracy build, so this brackets
//! the UI pipeline with three timestamps around the public system sets:
//!
//! ```text
//!   A ── UiSystems::Prepare ‥ Propagate ‥ Content ── B ── Layout ── C
//!        └──────── content (text measurement) ──────┘   └─ taffy ─┘
//! ```
//!
//! `content` is where glyph shaping and intrinsic sizing happen — the half that
//! collapsing a section actually skips. `layout` is taffy solving the tree.
//! Splitting them matters: they have completely different fixes. Text-bound
//! means fewer/cheaper labels; taffy-bound means fewer nodes.
//!
//! The spans cover everything scheduled in those sets, not solely bevy's own
//! systems — which is the honest thing to report, since a plugin's layout-time
//! system costs the frame just as much.
//!
//! ## Counting is gated
//!
//! Walking every `Node` to report totals would itself cost frame time in a
//! panel about frame time. The counts refresh only while this panel is the
//! active tab, and then only every 30 frames.

// `bevy::platform::time::Instant`, never `std`'s — std's panics on wasm.
